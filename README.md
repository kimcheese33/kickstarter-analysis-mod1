# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is a campaign manager who oversees a wide variety of campaigns; she has many successful campaigns, as well as many failed ones. In order to help her put together her next successful campaign, she has brought us in to analyze the Kickstarter dataset. This dataset contains data about thousands of campaigns. As a result, it is meaningless at first glance. By utilizing Excel to perform various analyses, we can help Louise gain insight on how well campaigns perform based on their launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to get familiarized with how Excel can be used to large quantities of data. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
