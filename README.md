# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is a campaign manager who oversees a wide variety of campaigns; she has many successful campaigns, as well as many failed ones. In order to help her put together her next successful campaign, she has brought me, a budding data analyst, in to analyze the Kickstarter dataset. This dataset contains data about thousands of campaigns. As a result, it is meaningless at first glance. By utilizing Excel to perform various analyses, I can help Louise gain insight on how well campaigns perform based on their launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
As a student, the purpose of this project was to become familiarized with the powerful analytical tools Excel provides. Although Excel is a very commonly used tool, a lot of the concepts and tools presented in this course were unfamiliar to me. It was very interesting to see the wide variety of tools Excel provides to perfrom data analysis. In my current role as a data engineer I mainly analyze data stored in databases, not Excel, so learning about pivot tables, vlookups, countifs, etc. was very helpful.

As an analyst brought in by Louise, the purpose of this project was to make some sense of the Kicktarter dataset. Data can hold a wealth of information if you are given the tools. This project was successful in that we were able to provide Louise with a clearer path she might take for her next campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Looking at the outcomes based on launch date for theater campaigns it is clear that we get the most successful outcomes during May and June as shown below:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
